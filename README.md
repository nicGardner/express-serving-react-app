# express-serving-react-app

This web app can be found here: https://mern-cow-example.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple React app that is served from an Express backend.
I built this application following this tutorial: https://medium.com/@chloechong.us/how-to-deploy-a-create-react-app-with-an-express-backend-to-heroku-32decfee6d18 by Chloe Chong.
I made this application to learn how to host React applications with an Express backend online.
